# Ruby Sort

This code was a way for me to practice writing Ruby code by implementing common sorting algorithms using [what I created with Typescript](https://github.com/richardwalenga/typescriptsort) as a guide. I have logging in [test/test.rb](test/test.rb) which times the implementations against the same large array of random ints. I developed this with Ruby 3.0.3 but I am fairly certain it can be ran against older versions.

## First Steps

Run the following to ensure dependencies are installed:
```
bundle install
```

## Running

To run the test task, just execute this:
```
rake test
```

For convenience I added a VSCode task called "Run Tests" which runs the same command.
