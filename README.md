# Ruby Sort

This code was a way for me to practice writing Ruby code by implementing common sorting algorithms using [what I created with Typescript](https://github.com/richardwalenga/typescriptsort) as a guide. I have logging in [test/test.py](test/test.py) which times the implementations against the same large array of random ints.
